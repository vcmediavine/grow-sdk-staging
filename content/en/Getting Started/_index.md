The Grow JavaScript SDK provides access to Grow web services via browser scripts. This section features exercises to show you how to work with the SDK.

## Before You Begin

- Make sure you've created a Grow publisher account.
- Follow the installation steps to get Grow loading on your website.
- Have a browser window open with the site that's running Grow.

## Installation

Where can your user find your project code? How can they install it (binaries, installable package, build from source)? Are there multiple options/versions they can install and how should they choose the right one for them?

## Setup

Is there any initial setup users need to do after installation to try your project?

## Try it out!

Can your users test their installation, for example by running a command or deploying a Hello World example?
